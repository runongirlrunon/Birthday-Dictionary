For this assignment, you will implement a dictionary to track the name and birthday of your friends and relatives.  You should be able to do the following operations:
- add an entry
- remove an entry
- search the dictionary for the birthday for a given name
- display the name and birthday of every entry in the dictionary
- list everyone in the dictionary who was born in a given month
Thus, the search key is the name, and you may assume that the names are unique.
Design and implement a C++ class to represent a person, which contains a name and a birthday at minimum.  Additionally, design and implement a C++ class to represent an ADT dictionary of person objects.
Searching for a person in your database must be an average-case O(log n) operation; adding and removing can be O(n).  With this requirement in mind, it is up to you which type of dictionary to use.  You are free to leverage any work done in previous assignments.
You may create an interactive program which supports all of the required operations, or you may hard-code a sequence of operations.
